# Random-Password-Generator
## Description

I have made an application using JavaScript so that when Generate Password button is clicked a random password is generated by the user requesting it using specified characters and length. This must be at least 10 characters long and a maximum of 64 characters and must include one type of character.

## Usage

When user interacts with the button on the page a random password will be generated according to user input.
